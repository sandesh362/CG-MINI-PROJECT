# CG-MINI-PROJECT
This Chess Game is developed in C using the Turbo C graphics library. It offers a classic chess experience with a functional board and player controls. This project demonstrates my skills in C programming, graphics handling, and game logic. Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest improvements!
